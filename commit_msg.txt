This commit introduces full OS automation support in KYRAX with a safe, testable,
and policy-driven design, implemented incrementally across multiple phases.

Key highlights:

Phase 1–2:
- Added OS domain intents (open_app, close_app, set_volume, mute, unmute)
- Introduced OSSkill with platform-aware backends
- Default dry-run mode to prevent destructive execution

Phase 3:
- Integrated GuardManager for centralized safety enforcement
- Added confirmation flow for destructive actions
- Unified dispatcher → guard → skill execution pipeline

Phase 4:
- Introduced OS policy layer (os_policy.py)
- Defined allowed OS intents and high-risk intents
- Centralized dry-run detection via environment configuration

Phase 5:
- Implemented role-based access control for OS actions
- Enforced admin-only execution for high-risk OS intents
- Ensured deterministic, test-safe behavior across platforms

Overall:
- OS automation is now safe-by-default
- Destructive actions are guarded, confirmable, and role-aware
- Runtime behavior and test behavior are aligned
- Architecture cleanly separates policy, guards, and execution

This lays a stable foundation for future Phase-6 extensions without compromising system safety.
