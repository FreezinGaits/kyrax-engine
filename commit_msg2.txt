feat(voice): integrate voice commands and improve contact resolution

- Add `WhisperVoiceAdapter` in `kyrax_core/adapters/voice_adapter.py` for speech-to-text.
- Update `examples/run_pipeline.py` to support voice input mode and toggle.
- Improve `ContactResolver` with transcription corrections (e.g., "Gotham" -> "Gautam") and punctuation stripping.
- Refactor `WhatsAppSkill` to avoid unnecessary browser recycles when a contact is not found.
- Enhance CLI output with clear success/failure indicators.
