feat(pipeline): stabilize regex-first execution with multi-command OS + WhatsApp support

This commit establishes a stable milestone for the KYRAX execution pipeline
with deterministic, regex-driven command handling and real OS execution enabled.

Key capabilities confirmed working:
- Regex-first parsing for mixed-domain commands (application + OS)
- Sequential execution of multiple intents in a single user input
- WhatsApp message fan-out to multiple contacts in one sentence
- Real OS actions enabled (dry-run fully disabled via unified policy)
  - set_volume (absolute %)
  - mute / unmute
  - open_app (path-based executables like Chrome)
- Correct execution order preserved across domains
- Dispatcher + GuardManager integration stable for non-destructive OS intents

Examples verified:
- "send hi to gautam"
- "set volume to 20 percent"
- "send hi to Gautam and open chrome and set volume to 80"
- "send hi to Ravish and Gautam hello and Piyush test and set volume 40 and open chrome"

Architecture notes:
- Regex pipeline now acts as the primary, deterministic execution path
- LLM usage is secondary and only triggered when regex parsing is unsafe or insufficient
- os_policy is now the single source of truth for dry-run behavior
- KYRAX_OS_DRY_RUN=false correctly enables real OS side effects
- SkillRegistry, Dispatcher, ChainExecutor, and ContextLogger are wired end-to-end

Known limitations (intentional, to be addressed later):
- Windows Store apps (e.g., WhatsApp desktop) not yet launched via AppUserModelID
- LLM-backed NLU can fail under Gemini model availability/rate limits
- No rollback/transaction semantics across multi-step command chains
- OS close_app and high-risk intents not yet validated end-to-end
