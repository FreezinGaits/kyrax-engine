# kyrax-engine
KYRAX Engine is an AI-first system designed to reason, plan, and execute complex tasks across operating systems, applications, and IoT devices. Unlike conventional voice assistants or automation platforms, KYRAX places intelligence at the core and treats voice, text, and vision as input modalities rather than the system itself.
